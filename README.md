## How It Works
1. The JavaScript function calculates the time difference between the current date and time and midnight of January 1st of the next year.
2. The `setInterval` function is used to update the countdown values every second.
3. The remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds are displayed in a structured layout on the page.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure all files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) are in the same directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

## File Structure
```
|-- index.html     # Main HTML file

## Future Enhancements
- Add a festive animation or sound effect when the countdown reaches zero.
- Allow users to customize the background image or theme.
